### üì¶ Install

There are several methods for downloading and installing the `pizza` CLI:

#### Homebrew

```sh
brew install open-sauced/tap/pizza
```

#### Direct script install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-sauced/pizza-cli/main/install.sh | sh
```

This is a convenience script that can be downloaded from GitHub directly and
piped into `sh` for conveniently downloading the latest GitHub release of the
`pizza` CLI.

Once download is completed, you can move the binary to a convenient location in
your system's `$PATH`.

> [!WARNING]
> It may not be advisable to pipe scripts from GitHub directly into
> a command line interpreter! If you do not fully trust the source, first
> download the script, inspect it manually to ensure its integrity, and then
> run it:
> ```sh
> curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-sauced/pizza-cli/main/install.sh > install.sh
> vim install.sh
> ./install.sh
> ```

#### Manual build and install

```
make install
```

This is a convenience `make` target for building and dropping the pizza CLI into
`/usr/local/bin/` (which requires `sudo` permissions).
Make sure you have that directory in your path: `export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"`.
Otherwise, you can build it manually with `make build` and `mv build/pizza <somewhere-in-your-path>`.

In the future, we will be dropping regular GitHub releases where you can easily
download and install pre-built binaries.

### üñ•Ô∏è Local Development

You'll need a few tools to get started:

- The [Go toolchain](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (for linting and other tooling)
- Make

To lint, run `make lint`. To run tests, run `make test`. To build, run `make build`.
