### üñ•Ô∏è Local Development

You'll need a few tools to get started:

- The [Go toolchain](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (for linting and other tooling)
- Make

To lint, run `make lint`. To run tests, run `make test`. To build, run `make build`.

### üèóÔ∏è Installation

#### Manual build and install

```
make install
```

This is a convenience target for building and dropping the pizza CLI into
`/usr/local/bin/` (which requires `sudo` permissions).
Make sure you have that directory in your path: `export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"`.
Otherwise, you can build it manually with `make build` and `mv build/pizza <somewhere-in-your-path>`.

In the future, we will be dropping regular GitHub releases where you can easily
download and install pre-built binaries.
